    Hey there! My name is Peter Cheng, a mathematician and software engineer. I received my PhD in
    mathematics from UCLA, where I did research in the field of numerical analysis. More
    specifically, I studied a class of numerical methods for solving ordinary differential equations
    which I named "spline deferred correction."

    I currently work at Roblox on the physics engine team. In a nutshell, we make sure physics works
    as expected across the platform. Previously, I worked on the FX/CFX production software team,
    with a focus on the proprietary fire/dust/gas and hair simulation engines. You can find my name
    in the credits of all of the DreamWorks' films between 2019 and 2022! Maybe except for one...

    I'm also passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge with those around me, which is the
    inspiration for this website!
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">When I'm not working, I dabble in a lot of projects:</p>

      I'm a part-time computational consultant for the <a
        href="https://seguralab.duke.edu/"
        class="text-penn-red hover:underline">Segura Lab</a
      > at Duke University. I work with various members of the research team in developing software for
      analyzing the void space of packed particles.

      I'm very interested in this AI revolution that we're experiencing with GPT and related
      technologies, so I often spend my time building small apps that allow me to experiment with
      GPT. I would love to hear about the ideas you have!

      This website, which serves two purposes: (1) it encourages me to document things I've learned
      to more easily share with others, and (2) it has allowed me to learn some basic frontend
      skills via <a href="https://astro.build" class="text-penn-red hover:underline">Astro</a>.

      I also try and keep up with my Korean studies as much as I can. 근데 시간이 많이 없어~ ㅠㅠ
