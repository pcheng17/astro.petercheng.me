    Hi! I'm Peter Cheng, and I work on the physics engine at Roblox. Previously, I worked on the
    proprietary fire/dust/gas and hair simulation engines at DreamWorks. As you can probably tell,
    math and simulations are my jam.
  </p>
  <p>When I'm not working, I dabble in a lot of projects:</p>
  <ul class="block list-disc my-4 pl-10">
    <li>
      This website, which serves two purposes: (1) it encourages me to document things I've learned,
      and (2) it has allowed me to learn some basic frontend skills via <a
        href="https://astro.build"
        class="text-penn-red hover:underline">Astro</a
      >.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm a part-time computational consultant for the <a
        href="https://seguralab.duke.edu/"
        class="text-penn-red hover:underline">Segura Lab</a
      > at Duke University. I work with various members of the research team in developing software for
      analyzing the void space of packed particles.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm very interested in this AI revolution that we're experiencing with GPT and related
      technologies, so I often spend my time building small apps that allow me to experiment with
      GPT. I would love to hear about the ideas you have!
    </li>
    <li>
      I also try and keep up with my Korean studies as much as I can. 근데 시간이 많이 없어~ ㅠㅠ
