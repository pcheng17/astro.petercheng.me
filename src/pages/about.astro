    Hey there! My name is Peter, a mathematician and software engineer who is passionate about
    designing solutions to aid others in their creativity, especially in the field of graphics and
    animation. I prioritize understanding the mindset of engineers and creatives alike to propose
    solutions that best fit their workflow.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">
    I'm also passionate about teaching and sharing knowledge with those around me, which stems from
    my genuine curiosity for different people's thought processes. I have been told I have a knack
    for teaching, and I hope that I can continue to inspire others in this way regardless of my
    career path.
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">When I'm not working, I dabble in a lot of projects:</p>
  <ul class="block list-disc my-4 pl-10">
    <li>
      This website, which serves two purposes: (1) it encourages me to document things I've learned,
      and (2) it has allowed me to learn some basic frontend skills via <a
        href="https://astro.build"
        class="text-penn-red hover:underline">Astro</a
      >.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm a part-time computational consultant for the <a
        href="https://seguralab.duke.edu/"
        class="text-penn-red hover:underline">Segura Lab</a
      > at Duke University. I work with various members of the research team in developing software for
      analyzing the void space of packed particles.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm very interested in this AI revolution that we're experiencing with GPT and related
      technologies, so I often spend my time building small apps that allow me to experiment with
      GPT. I would love to hear about the ideas you have!
    </li>
    <li>
      I also try and keep up with my Korean studies as much as I can. 근데 시간이 많이 없어~ ㅠㅠ
