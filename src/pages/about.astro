    Hey there! My name is Peter Cheng, a mathematician and software engineer. I currently work at
    Roblox on the physics engine team. In a nutshell, we make sure physics works as expected across
    the platform. Previously, I worked on the FX/CFX production software team, with a focus on the
    proprietary fire/dust/gas and hair simulation engines. I'm also passionate about teaching and
    sharing knowledge with those around me, which is the inspiration for this website!
  </p>
  <p class="my-4">When I'm not working, I dabble in a lot of projects:</p>
  <ul class="block list-disc my-4 pl-10">
    <li>
      This website, which serves two purposes: (1) it encourages me to document things I've learned
      to more easily share with others, and (2) it has allowed me to learn some basic frontend
      skills via <a href="https://astro.build" class="text-penn-red hover:underline">Astro</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm a part-time computational consultant for the <a
        href="https://seguralab.duke.edu/"
        class="text-penn-red hover:underline">Segura Lab</a
      > at Duke University. I work with various members of the research team in developing software for
      analyzing the void space of packed particles.
    </li>
    <li>
      I'm very interested in this AI revolution that we're experiencing with GPT and related
      technologies, so I often spend my time building small apps that allow me to experiment with
      GPT. I would love to hear about the ideas you have!
    </li>
    <li>
      I also try and keep up with my Korean studies as much as I can. 근데 시간이 많이 없어~ ㅠㅠ
