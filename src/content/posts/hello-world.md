Hello, world! I now have a little corner on the interwebs all to myself.

I'm planning to use this space as a way to record things that I learn that I want to save
for my future self. Back in school, I was never much of a note-taker, but I've begun to realize the
importance of writing things down. Our brains are great at producing new ideas, but terrible at
remembering things.

This website is built by me with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and 
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's been a lot of fun learning basic
frontend-skills, and I'm looking forward to seeing how this website grows overtime!

This was inspired by the work of many others, in no particular order:
- Josh Branchaud's [repository](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) aptly named "Today I Learned"
- Shawn Wang's essay, [Learn In Public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/)
- Austin Kleon's [Show Your Work!](https://austinkleon.com/show-your-work/)
- Simon Boehm's [website/blog](https://siboehm.com/)
- Bonsoon Lin's [website](https://radiofreemath.org/)
