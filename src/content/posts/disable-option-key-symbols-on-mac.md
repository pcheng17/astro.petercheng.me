I recently discovered that Mac users have the ability to easily type out various symbols using `âŒ¥ + <letter>` combinations (that's the symbol for the Option key). For example,
 
- `âŒ¥ s` insertsÂ `ÃŸ`Â at cursor, and 
- `âŒ¥ w`Â insertsÂ `âˆ‘`Â at cursor.

[Here](https://mackeeper.com/blog/special-characters-mac-keyboard/) is a list of these symbols and their trigger. However, this wasn't a feature I wanted or needed on my keyboard.

<!-- Maybe remove this bit about my keyboard because it adds nothing. -->
In short, my daily (keyboard) driver is the [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd), a 42-key split ortholinear keyboard. I love this thing, but the lack of keys when compared to a standard keyboard has forced me (and all other users of this type of keyboard) to be a little more clever with where many keys are placed; for example, the number, symbol, and modifier keys. I've adopted the well-known[^1] configuration of using something known as [home-row modifiers](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods). Basically, the modifiers are placed right on the home-row of my keyboard but only activated when I hold down the appropriate keys. I know, it probably doesn't make too much sense... but basically, because the modifier keys are on my home-row keys, there's a non-zero chance that I'll accidentally trigger a modifier combination when I don't intend to because of lazy typing, and this is how I accidentally discovered the `âŒ¥ + <letter>` combinations. 

Okay, back to the main purpose of this post! I dug around for a little longer than expected, but came across a nice solution to disable the `âŒ¥ + <letter>` combinations. See [here](https://superuser.com/a/942256) for the solution along with an explanation. However, I will copy and paste the gist of it here 

> Save the following toÂ `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict`Â (create if necessary).
